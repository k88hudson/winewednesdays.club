      <h3>Want to bring wine?</h3>
      <p>Awesome!!! Contacting Kate Hudson (:k88hudson) or host@winewednesdays.club to let
      us know what you're bringing will help with coordinating our other wines / cheeses.</p>

      <h3>Where do we get our wine / cheese / bread?</h3>

      <p>Most of our wines are in the $15â€“$30 range bought locally or through private order. Sometimes our members
      and visitors bring us wine from around the world, which is always a treat!</p>

      <p>Our cheeses are from <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/nYo8UNDA95m">Global Cheese</a> in Kensington Market, a local cheesemonger that has been serving
      Toronto for many years. Their staff are really helpful with pairings and recommendations, tell
      them we sent you!</p>

      <p>Our bread is freshly baked from <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/caUwZuQTcyL2">Blackbird Bakery</a>, which is just accross the street from
      Global Cheese.</p>
